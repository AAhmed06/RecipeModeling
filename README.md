# Cooking Time & Ratings: An Exploratory Analysis and Predictive Model

Author: Ali Ahmed

### Introduction

Food is an integral part of everyone's lives, and understanding what we cook and eat can have major impacts on our health, wellness, and happiness. As such, when it comes to cooking, it is useful to know what factors go into making one recipe better than another.
Additionally, time is an important factor in choosing what dishes we cook, as the finite amount of time we have in a day impacts 
the decisions that we make, which also applies to the food we eat and cook.
This project aims to solve a multi-class classification problem where the goal is to predict a recipe's rating on a 1-to-5 scale using features engineered from time-based data.
In order to do this, I am analyzing two datasets containing recipes and online interactions with said recipes.
The first dataset is  `recipes` and contains 83782 rows as well as 10 columns.
